/*
 * A program which produces some common memory leaks and errors that can be
 * dectected using valgrind
 * 
 * (c) Sydney Nepo, Tufts University, Fall 2021
 *
 * Valgrind is a tool useful for detecting memory leaks and errors in your 
 * program. This file contains examples of some common issues that you can 
 * use valgrind to catch. To run your program with valgrind, do the 
 * following: 
 *      - Compile your program with the -g flag. This will make error 
 *        reading easier. To compile this program, run: 
 *
 *      g++ -o valgrinderrors -g -Wall -Wextra -Werror valgrinderrors.cpp
 *
 *      - Run your program with valgrind. The terminal command for this 
 *        example is: 
 *      
 *      valgrind ./valgrinderrors
 *
 *      - If your program is interactive, interact with it until it terminates. 
 *        This program is not interactive, so it will terminate without any 
 *        input.
 *
 *      - Read the valgrind output. Specifically, in the summary you want to 
 *        look at the following things: 
 *              - HEAP SUMMARY: This field should always be 72,704 bytes in 
 *                              1 blocks. It is also expected to have exactly 
 *                              1 more allocs than frees
 *              - LEAK SUMMARY: There should be 0 bytes in 0 blocks for all of 
 *                              the "lost" categories. 
 *              - ERROR SUMMARY: This should say 0 errors from 0 contexts
 *
 *      - If any of the summaries do not appear as described above, you have 
 *        a bug! Scroll up to parse through the error messages, starting with 
 *        the topmost error. It is okay if you do not fully understand these 
 *        error messages, just try to gather enough information to figure out 
 *        where the error is coming from!
