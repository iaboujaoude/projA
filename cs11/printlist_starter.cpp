 * printlist.cpp  -- shows how to read a list of numbers into an array
 *
 *      1. read in data
 *      2. then prints out the list with line numbers using another loop
 *
 *   Exercises:
 *    [a] print the list in reverse
 *    [b] change loop to print out only the birthdays in October
 *    [c] after printing out the October bdays, print a count of how many
 *    [d] change to print the count for each month, not the actual bdays
 *    [e] use a function to do [c]
 *    [f] EXTRA: print which month has the MOST birthdays
 * 
 * Modified by:
